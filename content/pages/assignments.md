| Assignment 1 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps1)) | cSNPs.txt ([TXT - 4.2 MB](/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-508-quantitative-genomics-fall-2005/assignments/cSNPs.txt)) \[Human SNP data\]  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}SNPData.mat ([MAT]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/snpdata)) \[SNP data in MATLAB® friendly form. To upload in MATLAB®, just type load filename at the MATLAB® prompt.\] | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/hst508ps1_soln)) (Courtesy of Ken Roach. Used with permission.) |
| Assignment 2 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps2)) | parseBLATAlignment.m ([M](/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-508-quantitative-genomics-fall-2005/assignments/parseBLATAlignment.m)) \[MATLAB® function. Use this function on the output of BLAT for each gene to figure out where the human and chimp sequences diverge, and how each change the codons.\]  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}These two text files are examples of how the data for each gene should look like:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}F10Human.txt ([TXT](/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-508-quantitative-genomics-fall-2005/assignments/F10Human.txt)) \[Factor 10 human sequence. This file is the sequence for the coding region of coagulation factor X obtained from NCBI. This is what you BLAT against the chimp genome. Save the output of BLAT in F10Blat.txt.\]  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}F10Blat.txt ([TXT](/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-508-quantitative-genomics-fall-2005/assignments/F10Blat.txt)) \[Factor 10 Blat Output. The F10Blat.txt is given as input to the MATLAB® function that will output the divergent codons between the human and chimp sequences.\] | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/hst508ps2_soln)) (Courtesy of Ken Roach.

| Assignment 3 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps3)) | SerProteases\_PS3.pdb ([PDB](/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-508-quantitative-genomics-fall-2005/assignments/SerProteases_PS3.pdb)) \[Overlapped structures of serine proteases.\] |
